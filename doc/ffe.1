.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B ffe
.RI [ options ]...

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBffe\fP is a program for extracting fields from flat file records and displaying them in different formats. \fBffe\fP relies on the configuration file to control input file structure and the output format.
.SH "OPTIONS"
\fBffe\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 
.BR  \-c ", " \-\-configuration=\fIfile\fP

.PP 
All remaining arguments are names of input files;
if no input files are specified, then the standard input is read.

.SS Expressions (option \-e, \-\-expression)
Expression can be used to select specific records comparing field
values.

If the \fIvalue\fR starts with string "file:" then the rest of the \fIvalue\fR is considered
as a file name. Every line in the file is used as value in comparison. Record will be selected if one or more values evaluates true.

Expression notation:

.TP 
.BR  \fIfield\fR\fB=\fR\fIvalue\fR
A record will be selected if the field \fIfield\fR is equal to the value \fIvalue\fR.
.TP 
.BR  \fIfield\fR\fB^\fR\fIvalue\fR
A record will be selected if the field \fIfield\fR starts with the value \fIvalue\fR.
.TP 
.BR  \fIfield\fR\fB~\fR\fIvalue\fR
A record will be selected if the field \fIfield\fR contains the value \fIvalue\fR.
.TP 
.BR  \fIfield\fR\fB!\fR\fIvalue\fR
A record will be selected if the field \fIfield\fR is not equal to the value \fIvalue\fR.
.TP 
.BR  \fIfield\fR\fB?\fR\fIvalue\fR
A record will be selected if the field \fIfield\fR matches the regular expression in \fIvalue\fR.

	

.SH "FFE CONFIGURATION"
\fBffe\fR uses the configuration file for extracting fields from the input file and for formatting the fields for output. Every line or binary block of the input file is considered as a record. Default configuration file is \fB~/.fferc\fR but another file can be given with '\-c' option.
.PP 
Configuration file for \fBffe\fR is a text file. The file may contain empty lines. Commands are case\-sensitive. Comments  begin  with  the  #\-character and end at the end of the line. The \fIstring\fR and \fIchar\fR definitions can be enclosed in double quotation '"' characters. \fIchar\fR is a single character. \fIstring\fR and \fIchar\fR can contain following escape codes: '\ea','\eb','\et','\en','\ev','\ef', '\er', '\e"' and '\e#'. Character '\e' can be escaped as '\e\e'.

Command Substitution allows the output of a command to replace parts of the configuration file. Syntax for command substitution is:
.br 
`\fIcommand\fR`
.br 
The \fIcommand\fR is executed and the `\fIcommand\fR` is substituted with the standard output of the command, with any trailing newlines deleted. Command substitutions may not be nested.

Before executing the \fIcommand\fR ffe sets few environment variables:
.TP 
\fBFFE_STRUCTURE\fR
The name of the structure given using \-s,\-\-structure.
.TP 
\fBFFE_OUIPUT\fR
The name of the output file given using \-o,\-\-output.
.TP 
\fBFFE_FORMAT\fR
The name of the output format given using \-p,\-\-print.
.TP 
\fBFFE_FIRST_FILE\fR
The name of the first input file.
.TP 
\fBFFE_FILES\fR
A list of all input files.
.PP 
If variable is already set it will not be replaced.

.SS Input file structure
.PP 
Input file structures are specified with keyword \fBstructure\fR:
.PP 
\fBstructure\fR \fIname\fR {options...}
.PP 
Options must be ended with newline, options are:
.PP 
.TP 
\fBtype\fR \fBfixed\fR|\fBbinary\fR|\fBseparated\fR [\fIchar\fR] [\fB*\fR]
Fields in the input are fixed length text fields, fixed length binary fields or text fields separated by \fIchar\fR. If * is given, multiple sequential separators are considered as one. Default separator is comma.
.TP 
\fBquoted\fR [\fIchar\fR]
Fields may be quoted with \fIchar\fR, default quotation mark is double quotation mark '"'.
A quotation mark is assumed to be escaped as \e\fIchar\fR or doubling the mark as \fIchar\fR\fIchar\fR in input. Non escaped quotation marks are not preserved in output.
.TP 
\fBheader\fR \fBfirst\fR|\fBall\fR|\fBno\fR
Controls the occurrence of the header line. Default is no. If set as first or all, the first line of the first input file is considered as header line containing the names of the fields. First means that only the first file has a header, all means that all files have a header, although the names are still taken from the header of the first file. Header line is handled according the record definition, meaning that the name positions, separators etc. are the same as for the fields.
.TP 
\fBoutput\fR \fIname\fR
All records belonging this structure are printed according output format \fIname\fR. Default is to use output named as 'default'.
.TP 
\fBrecord\fR \fIname\fR {options...}
Defines one record for a structure. A structure can contain several record types.
.SS Record options:
.PP 
.TP 
\fBid\fR \fIposition\fR \fIstring\fR
.TP 
\fBrid\fR \fIposition\fR \fIregexp\fR
Identifies a record in the input file. Records are identified by the \fIstring\fR or by the regular expression in \fIregexp\fR in input record position \fIposition\fR. For fixed length and binary input the \fIposition\fR is the byte position of the input record and for separated input the \fIposition\fR means the \fIposition\fR'th field of the input record. Positions start from one.

\fBId\fR's are required only if input structure contains several record types with equal lengths or field counts. Non printable characters can be escaped as \fB\exnn\fR where \fBnn\fR is the hexadecimal value of the character.
 
A record definition can contain several \fBid\fR's, then all \fBid\fR'd must match the input line (\fBid\fR's are combined with logical and).

In a multi\-record binary structure every record must have at least one \fBid\fR.
.TP 
\fBfield\fR \fIname\fR|\fBFILLER\fR|\fB*\fR [\fIlength\fR]|\fB*\fR [\fIlookup\fR]|\fB*\fR [\fIoutput\fR]
Specifies one field in a text input structure. \fIlength\fR is mandatory for fixed length input structure except for the last field. If the last field of a fixed length input structure has a \fB*\fR in place of \fIlength\fR then the last field can have arbitrary length.

Length is also used for printing fields in fixed length format using the \fB%D\fR directive. The order of fields in configuration file is essential, it specifies the field order in a record.

If '*' is given instead of the name,  then the 'name' will be the ordinal number of the field, or if the 'header' option has value 'first' or 'all', then the name of the field will taken from the header line (first line of the input).

If \fIlookup\fR is given then the fields contents is used to  make a lookup in lookup table \fIlookup\fR. If length is not needed (separated format) but lookup is needed, use asterisk (*) in place of length definition.

If \fIoutput\fR is given field is printed using output \fIoutput\fR. Use asterisk in place of lookup if lookup is not needed.

Naming the field as FILLER causes field not to be printed in output.
.TP 
\fBfield\fR \fIname\fR|\fBFILLER\fR|\fB*\fR [\fIlength\fR]|\fItype\fR [\fIlookup\fR]|\fB*\fR [\fIoutput\fR]
Specifies one field in a binary input structure. All other features are same as for the text structure except the \fItype\fR parameter.

.SS Lookup definitions

.TP 
\fBlookup\fR \fIname\fR {options...}
Defines one lookup table.

.SS Lookup options:
.TP 
\fBsearch\fR \fBexact\fR|\fBlongest\fR

.TP 
\fBdefault\-value\fR \fIvalue\fR
 \fIvalue\fR is printed if the lookup is not successful.
.TP 
\fBpair\fR \fIkey\fR \fIvalue\fR
One key/value pair for the lookup table.
.TP 
\fBfile\fR \fIname\fR [\fIseparator\fR]
Key/value pairs are read from file \fIname\fR. Every line is considered as a key/value pair separated
by \fIseparator\fR. Default separator is semicolon.

.SS Constants
Additional to input fields constants values can be printed using option \fB\-f\fR,\fB\-\-field\-list\fR or 
output option \fBfield\-list\fR. Constant will be printed using \fBdata\fR output option.

Constants are specified as
.TP 
\fBconst\fR \fIname\fR \fIvalue\fR
when the \fIname\fR appears in a field list, \fIvalue\fR will be printed for every record as the \fIname\fR were one of the input fields.

.SS Input Preprocessor

It is possible to define an input preprosessor for \fBffe\fR. An input preprocessor is simply an executable program which writes the contents of the input file to standard output which will be read by \fBffe\fR. If the input preprosessor does not write any characters on its standard output, then \fBffe\fR uses the original file.

To set up an input preprocessor, set the \fBFFEOPEN\fR environment variable to a command line which will invoke your input preprocessor. This command line should include one occurrence of the string \fB%s\fR, which will be replaced by the input filename when the input preprocessor command is invoked.

The input preprocessor is not used if \fBffe\fR is reading standard input.
